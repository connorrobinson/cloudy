GOALS FOR MODELS:

List of densities (which is a proxy for height above the midplane) as input to cloudy
Solve equations of radiative transfer at each height

Decide on a stopping criteria (perhaps tau = 5 at 10 Î¼m?)

Produce a SED of verticle cut of the wall

Eventually be able to plug in a real stellar photosphere, perhaps a dwarf spectra + accretion shock
